## 1. Introduction

The Urine Strip Color Identifier is a web application built with Django, designed to help users identify the colors present in different regions of a urine strip. This tool is particularly useful in medical and healthcare applications where it's essential to analyze urine samples quickly and efficiently.

## 2. Features

- **Upload an Image**: Users can upload an image of a urine strip for color analysis.
- **Color Identification**: The application processes the uploaded image to identify and display the colors present in different regions of the strip.
- **Data Storage**: The uploaded image and the corresponding color data are stored in the database for future reference.
- **Extensibility**: The project is built using the Django web framework, making it easy to add more features and functionalities as needed.

## 3. Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **pip (Python package manager)**
- **Git (optional but recommended)**

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine. You can either use Git or download the ZIP file.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/urine-strip-project.git
    ```

2. Change to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd urine-strip-project
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On macOS and Linux:

        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

5. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Apply database migrations:

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

7. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

8. Access the application in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## 4. Usage

1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Click the "Choose File" button to select an image of a urine strip.
3. Click the "Upload" button to process the image.
4. The application will identify the colors in different regions of the strip and display the results.

## 5. Customization

You can customize the color regions and their thresholds in the `utils.py` file to match the specific color ranges of your urine strips. The `color_regions` dictionary in `utils.py` defines the color ranges for different urine strip components. You can adjust these ranges according to your requirements.
